This is "Coder Face" by Charlotte and Louisa. We were inspired by Lady Gaga's "Poker Face."

The song references several important CS1101 topics such as recursion, OOP and regex. 
The lyrics mention common errors that students make when learning these topics, the difficulties 
they may face when trying to take future CS classes, and are humorous! Enjoy!
